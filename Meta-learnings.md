## **General Reflection and Metacognition**

### **Daily/Weekly Practices:**

- **Reflective Journaling:** At the end of each day or week, spend 15–30 minutes writing about:
    - What new concepts you learned.
    - How these concepts link to your previous knowledge.
    - Questions that arose and how they might relate to real-world backend challenges.
- **Peer Reviews & Code Reviews:**  
    Share your projects with peers or in community forums. Request feedback focusing on architecture, design decisions, and scalability.
- **Teaching:** Try explaining a difficult concept (for example, Rust’s ownership model or Elixir’s actor model) in a blog post or a short talk. Teaching reinforces mastery.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Revisit your code and design after a week, applying the 80/20 rule by refining parts that yield the most benefit to performance or maintainability.

### **Bi-Monthly Checkpoints:**

- **Self-Evaluation Sessions:**  
    Every two weeks, schedule a self-review session where you:
    - Compare your current skills against the senior backend engineer benchmark.
    - Identify gaps in understanding or implementation.
    - Adjust your plan dynamically based on feedback and self-assessment.
- **Mentorship or Peer Sessions:**  
    Engage with experienced backend engineers (perhaps via community groups or online mentorship programs) to review your projects and discuss industry best practices.
