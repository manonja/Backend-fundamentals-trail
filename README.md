# Top-backend-DISSS - Mastering the Fundamentals of Backend Engineering: 3-Month Hands-On Course 

Welcome to the **Mastering Backend Engineering** course! This is a free, open-source curriculum designed to level up your programming fundamentals in **Rust**, **Elixir**, and advanced backend system design. If you never used Rust or Elixir, this is your opportunity. 

If you've written code in any programming language before, this book is for you—no matter which language that might be. We've designed the material to be approachable for individuals with diverse programming experiences. However, we don’t delve into the basics of what programming is or how to think like a programmer. If you're completely new to programming, starting with an introductory book tailored for beginners would be more beneficial.
