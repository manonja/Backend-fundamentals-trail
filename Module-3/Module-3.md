## **Module 3: Architecture, Microservices & Full-Stack Integration**

### **Module 3.1: Architectural Patterns & Design Principles**

**Key Concepts:**

- **Microservices Architecture:**  
    Learn design patterns for splitting applications into independent services, communication via REST, gRPC, or message queues.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):**  
    Understand bounded contexts and strategic design.
- **Scalability & Reliability Patterns:**  
    Study load balancing, caching, and fault tolerance.
- **Design Patterns:**  
    Implement common backend patterns (Repository, Circuit Breaker, etc.)

**Why It’s Important:**

- As a senior backend engineer, you need to design systems that are scalable, maintainable, and resilient. These patterns allow you to tackle complexity effectively.
- These principles are universal and apply regardless of the language or framework being used.

**Resources:**

- _Building Microservices_ by Sam Newman
- _Domain-Driven Design_ by Eric Evans
- Blog posts and talks by industry experts like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates on system design

**Hands-on Project:**

- **Microservices Ecosystem:**  
    Design and build a small ecosystem of intercommunicating services. For example, create separate services for user authentication, data processing, and notifications. Use a combination of Rust and Elixir services to understand cross-language interoperability.
- **Reflection:** Document your architecture decisions, the trade-offs you faced, and how each service adheres to the principles of DDD and microservices.

### **Module 3.2: End-to-End System Integration and Deployment**

**Key Concepts:**

- **CI/CD Pipelines & DevOps:**  
    Learn automation for builds, tests, and deployment. Understand containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
- **Monitoring & Observability:**  
    Implement logging, distributed tracing, and health checks.
- **Security Considerations:**  
    Dive into secure coding practices, encryption, and authentication/authorization strategies.

**Why It’s Important:**

- A senior backend engineer not only builds systems but also ensures they’re deployed and maintained reliably in production. DevOps and observability are critical skills.
- These systems ensure that your work remains operable, scalable, and secure.

**Resources:**

- Online courses on Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD (e.g., from Udacity, Pluralsight, or Kubernetes Academy)
- Blogs and whitepapers by industry experts (like Netflix’s tech blog on observability)

**Hands-on Project:**

- **Deploying Your Microservices Ecosystem:**  
    Containerize your microservices ecosystem and deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster (or a managed service like AWS EKS/GKE). Include monitoring dashboards (using Prometheus/Grafana) and logging setups.
- **Reflection:** Create a runbook or a detailed deployment documentation. Review what automated monitoring and CI/CD mean for the stability and maintainability of systems in production.
