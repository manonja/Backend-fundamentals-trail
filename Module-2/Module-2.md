## **Module 2: Language & Concurrency (Rust & Elixir)**

### **Module 2.1: Deep Dive into Rust for Backend**

**Key Concepts:**

- **Memory Safety & Ownership:**  
    Learn Rust’s borrow checker, ownership model, and lifetimes.
- **Systems Programming:**  
    Dive into low-level network programming, efficient concurrency with Tokio, and error handling in Rust.
- **Interfacing with C & FFI:**  
    Understand how Rust can interface with legacy systems.

**Why It’s Important:**

- Rust gives you the ability to write performant and reliable code. It’s particularly suitable for CPU-intensive and concurrent applications.
- Knowing Rust will deepen your understanding of system-level issues and memory management, often abstracted in higher-level languages.

**Resources:**

- _The Rust Programming Language_ (a.k.a “The Book”)
- Official Rust documentation and community tutorials
- Projects and case studies from companies like Mozilla or Dropbox

**Hands-on Project:**

- **HTTP Microservice in Rust:** Build a robust HTTP service using frameworks like Actix-Web or Rocket. Focus on implementing safe concurrency patterns, error handling, and proper resource management.
- **Reflection:** Create a detailed post-mortem of your microservice design. Note the challenges in managing ownership and lifetimes and how Rust’s safety features guided your design.

### **Module 2.2: Mastering Elixir for Concurrency and Fault Tolerance**

**Key Concepts:**

- **Functional Programming Paradigms:**  
    Grasp immutability, recursion, and higher-order functions.
- **OTP (Open Telecom Platform) & Supervision Trees:**  
    Learn how Erlang/Elixir handles fault tolerance, process supervision, and concurrency.
- **Real-time Systems and Concurrency:**  
    Use Elixir’s lightweight processes (actors) to build scalable systems.

**Why It’s Important:**

- Elixir is a powerful language for building highly available, distributed systems. Its concurrency model is different from traditional threading, offering a fresh perspective on building resilient applications.
- Learning Elixir will help you think differently about state, fault tolerance, and distributed computing.

**Resources:**

- _Programming Elixir_ and _Elixir in Action_
- Official Elixir and Phoenix Framework guides
- Case studies from companies like Pinterest or WhatsApp that use Erlang/Elixir for scalable systems

**Hands-on Project:**

- **Real-time Chat Application:** Build a chat application using Phoenix Channels. Focus on demonstrating fault tolerance and handling thousands of concurrent connections gracefully.
- **Reflection:** Reflect on how the actor model and supervision trees contributed to the system’s resilience. Compare and contrast these with concurrency models in Rust.
